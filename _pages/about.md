# **Welcome to my page!**

· I am currently a Master's student in Mathematical Finance at the University of Southern California.<br>
 
· My interest lies on the intersection of quantitative finance, machine learning, and statistical theory, with a particular interest in option pricing and volatility modeling.<br>
 
· I am seeking a PhD position in Mathematical Finance, Statistics, or Economics, where I can apply my skills to solve challenging problems in these areas.<br>

# 📖 Educations
- *2024.08 -**NOW**, University of Southern California — **M.S. in Mathematical Finance**  
- *2020.09 - 2024.06*, Nanchang University — **B.S. in Mathematical Finance**

# 🔬 Research Experience
### Independent Research on Robust Multiple Testing
*Supervisor: Prof. Bowen Gang, Fudan University* | *Mar. 2025 – Sep. 2025*
- **Addressed** the critical challenge of controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in contaminated models where standard methods often fail.
- **Developed** a novel single-split, hold-out framework ('envelope-p') and **proved** a rigorous, non-asymptotic, and implementable finite-sample FDR bound for the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
- **Validated** the theoretical bound’s tightness via extensive simulations, with findings **prepared for a leading statistics journal manuscript.**

### Research Assistant, UCLA Trustworthy AI Lab
*Supervisor: Prof. Guang Cheng* | *June 2025 – Sep. 2025*
- **Engineered** an end-to-end data pipeline to ETL over 5 million minute-level data points from Polymarket & Deribit APIs, serving as the core infrastructure for a high-frequency trading framework.
    - *Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Asyncio), PostgreSQL, Docker, REST/WebSocket APIs*
- **Developed** and backtested a novel cross-market arbitrage strategy by modeling prediction market contracts as digital options, **yielding an 84.9% win rate** and a +0.051 Unit-ROI.
- **Built, live-tested, and optimized** an in-play MLB microstructure strategy by engineering a factor library from 600+ signals, **delivering a consistent +30% ROI** over 65 live trades.
